Overview
========

This document contains everything but naming conventions, pleas refer
to [CODE_STANDARDS_NAMING.md](CODE_STANDARDS_NAMING.md) for these details.

File Purpose Comments
=====================

Unless it is very obvious what the file's responsibility it is, this should be very clearly defined at the top using this comment block:

```
/**
 * Purpose: {defined purpose that makes it obvious what this file's
     singular responsibility is (think of the "S" in "SOLID"
     principles)}
 * Reason to change: {this should help make it clear whether the
     Single Responsibility Principle is being followed or not}
 */
```

For example, at the top of apiOrchestrationMiddleware.ts:
```
/**
 * Purpose: To determine when to make RESTful API calls based on actions that occur.
 * Reason to change: When new RESTful API calls are needed.
 */
```

Reducers
========

Types related to the data structure that the reducer stores in the state tree should be exported from the reducer itself.

Components
==========

Prefer React.FC components over the legacy style components.  Atoll started before functional components were widely used, so there
may still be some code that does not use FC, but don't be tempted to use these as templates for new components- rewrite using FC
instead.

Use `React.FC<ComponentNameProps>` as the default component definition where `ComponentName` will be your actual component name,
e.g. `MyButton`.

`ComponentNameProps` should be split into 2 interfaces:
- `ComponentNameStateProps` and `ComponentNameDispatchProps`

`ComponentNameStateProps` will contain the typical properties.
`ComponentNameDispatchProps` will contain event handler related properties.

To combine the these two interfaces use:
`type ComponentNameProps = ComponentNameStateProps & ComponentNameDispatchProps`

`ComponentNameStateProps` can be used for `mapStateToProps`
`ComponentNameDispatchProps` can be used for `mapDispatchToProps`


Switch Statements
=================

Case statements should always be enclosed in curly braces so that block scope is applied
and variables within these blocks are scoped to the block.  This allows a variable name to
be reused without errors being reported.

For example:
```
    switch (props.size) {
        case "xsmall": {
            className = css.xsmall;
            break;
        }
        case "small": {
            className = css.small;
            break;
        }
        default: {
            className = css.medium;
            break;
        }
    }
```

Import Statements
=================

Overview
--------

1. Imports should contain most specific import path.
2. Import statements should be grouped per "Import Sections" (see below).

Import File Paths
-----------------

VS Code may provide options such as `module ".."` and
`module "../reducers/rootReducer"`.  In this case
`"../reducers/rootReducer"` should be chosen because it is
the most specific path.

Import Sections
---------------

Import statments should be grouped into the following commented sections (try
to stick to this order as well):

| Section          |                                              |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| externals        | any third party module, e.g. React           |
| libraries        | anything imported from @atoll/* repos        |
| config           | any project related configuration consts     |
| utils            | any project related utility functions        |
| routes           | any project related routing config/functions |
| data access      | any project related data access functions    |
| actions          | any project related action creators          |
| components       | any project related JSX components used      |
| state            | any project related state                    |
| consts/enums     | any project related constants and enums      |
| interfaces/types | any project related interface or types       |
| style            | any project related css module references    |

This helps to identify inconsistencies in naming because it becomes obvious
when you group by category.  This also helps to make it obvious when a module
could be going beyond its single responsibility (and thereby violating SOLID
principles).

For example:
```
// externals
import React from "react";
import { hydrate } from "react-dom";
import { Provider } from "react-redux";
import { Route, Switch } from "react-router-dom";
import { ConnectedRouter } from "connected-react-router";

// utils
import { configureStore } from "@atoll/shared";
import { createClientHistory } from "@atoll/shared";
import { storeHistoryInstance } from "@atoll/shared";

// components
import { App } from "@atoll/shared";
import { ReviewViewContainer, SprintViewContainer } from "@atoll/shared";
import { IntlProvider } from "@atoll/shared";

// layouts
import { layouts } from "@atoll/shared";
```
