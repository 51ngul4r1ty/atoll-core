Data fetching in Redux apps: A 100% correct approach
----------------------------------------------------

This very opinionated article (by title) provided the basis for rolling our own redux-api-middleware.  Why didn't we just use
`redux-api-middleware`?  It didn't work with SSR!  So, back to the drawing board and, using the article below, we created something
quite similar to redux-api-middleware that was SSR compatible.  Note: there is another project out there that claims to do the same
but we weren't able to get it to work, and the effor involved to "roll our own" wasn't significant.
